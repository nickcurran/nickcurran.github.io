I&#8217;ve been getting grief for my lack of blog entries and [Flickr posts](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tcob/) lately. I&#8217;m not sure what it is. I posted a ton in January, but only once in February. I guess sometimes lots of things trigger a &#8220;Oh, I should blog that&#8221; response, and other times, nothing does. Oh well.

At any rate, I&#8217;ve been meaning to write about my [new toaster](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001552.php "Cool Tool: Back to Basics Toaster & Egg Poacher") for a while now. [Patrick](http://www.psoul.com) sent me that link a couple of months ago, killing two birds with one stone by introducing me to [a great blog](http://www.kk.org/cooltools) and my new [favorite appliance](http://www.backtobasicsproducts.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=31&products_id=113) all at the same time.

The egg and muffin toaster is really sweet. Poaches an egg in no more time than it takes to toast your english muffin, automatically turning itself off when it detects that no more water is left to steam. I pop in my ingredients before I dress in the morning, and when I&#8217;m ready to head out the door, I have a tasty Egg NickMuffin to eat in the car.

While we&#8217;re on breakfast, [this recipe](http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=drhjs4v_37crm3df) for Belgian waffles is out of this world. It&#8217;s the corn meal that makes the difference. I have been eating them every weekend morning (and then some) for two months!
