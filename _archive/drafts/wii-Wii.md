I eagerly jumped on the [Wii bandwagon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii "Wii - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") on Friday, luckily finding one through a coworker after a month of looking. It&#8217;s a neat system. I still haven&#8217;t been able to tear myself from World of Warcraft long enough to get in to Zelda, much to my surprise, but I&#8217;m rather addicted to [Wii Bowling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Sports). I enjoy the baseball as well. The Tennis is fun, but I&#8217;m bothered by the degree to which swinging the Wii Remote differs from actually swinging a Tennis Racket. Perhaps I&#8217;ll get over it, but I think it points to what I like about bowling and baseball, swinging the Wii Remote in those games more closely mirrors the actions of those sports. Nitpicking. It&#8217;s all fun.
