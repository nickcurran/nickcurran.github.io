I was saddened yesterday to learn that my favorite stand-up comedian, [Mitch Heberg](http://www.mitchhedberg.net/) had [died](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=492&e=7&u=/ap/obit_hedberg) on Wednesday. This is a real tragedy. I&#8217;m grateful that I was lucky enough to see him perform a few times. Mitch&#8217;s sense of humor was truly bizarre, and it was largely his nervous, stoner, staring-at-the-floor delivery that made his act so hilarious. One of my favorite Mitch one-liners is &#8220;I wish I could play little league now&#8230; I&#8217;d kick some fucking ass!&#8221; Another: &#8220;I bought an ant farm&#8230; those guys didn&#8217;t grow shit! C&#8217;mon guys, how &#8217;bout some carrots.&#8221; I&#8217;ll really miss him.

This news came out yesterday, so I&#8217;m guessing this _isn&#8217;t_ some sort of demented April Fool&#8217;s joke. Mitch wasn&#8217;t the publicity stunt type.
