Lessons I learned this weekend:

  1. If you&#8217;ve been drinking&#8230; especially gravity-fed, [upside-down margaritas](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tcob/138666528/in/set-72057594122566373/) in a barber chair right before a fast spin in said barber chair&#8230; driving around on a gas-powered scooter, AKA [Zooma](http://www.sdscooters.com/scooter%20pics/zooma/zooma.jpg), **is not a good idea**. If you&#8217;re lucky, you&#8217;ll only get some road rash. 
  2. No matter how sincerely she promises to not get angry or upset if things don&#8217;t go exactly how she imagined them, **never cut your girlfriend&#8217;s hair**. I knew it was a bad idea before I cut, and that was confirmed before the last hair hit the floor. On the other hand, it was fun, and her hair has already been complimented today!
