Ever since I bought this place two years ago this Saturday, I&#8217;ve had Murphy&#8217;s Law pounded in to my head. Shortly after I moved in, it became apparent that the developer was a [tremendous jerk](http://citypages.com/databank/20/995/article8326.asp). Apparent because when we discovered that we had what is commonly referred to as a &#8220;crack whore&#8221; living in our basement, he refused to help us change the locks, even when we found a Coach purse filled with baggies of feces under a stairwell. Never mind that once he finally did us the &#8220;service&#8221; of &#8220;allowing us&#8221; to change them, a few weeks later we found feces smeared all over the wall in the basement hallway. Awesome.

It seemed to get worse when we began to approach the transition date in May of 2005. This was the day when we were officially taking over the association from him. We had been trying to do it sooner, as was our legal right, but he kept trying to impede that as much as possible. It became evident weeks before the transition that we were going to end up paying him for May without getting services and without being left any sort of bank account. As the newly elected association president, I organized a sort of coup, collecting those dues instead of sending them to him.

This seemed to work out better than I expected, as it at least gave us something with which to start and hire a management company. I am certain that without that move, we never would have seen that money.

After that whole ordeal, I thought we&#8217;d be free and clear to just run the association without much drama. Not so. In the coming winter we would learn that

  * the water heaters needed to be replaced desperately: $7,000
  * the boiler needed urgent repairs: $3,000
  * the boiler would need to be _replaced_ in two years: $25,000

All this of course forced us to raise the dues dramatically. The problem was more that we had all been lured to this condo by our wonderfully low dues, figures which were unfortunately based on no sort of reality. People were not pleased and there was much discussion, but our hands were tied by circumstance. We need to raise reserve funds, despite questions like, &#8220;What could possibly go wrong that we would need all that money in reserve?&#8221;

So by this fall, after a spring and summer filled with wonderful events like&#8230;

  * a dog jumping off our roof
  * vagrants trying to sleep in our basement
  * a further dues increase and a big assessment for the boiler
  * a squirrel biting in to a transformer in the neighborhood (HUGE explosion sound)

&#8230;I finally began to think things were settling down. People were no longer trespassing. We had some planned repairs done on the boiler, and the building was nice and cozy during a cold October day. I had just adjusted the pressure on the boiler, and I settled down to take a look at some wedding details. I heard a loud crash outside and jokingly said to myself, &#8220;great, the boiler exploded,&#8221; actually assuming that it was another exploding squirrel or something.

Not so. A few minutes later, one of my fellow owners called to tell me I had to come outside immediately. A huge section of the south side, third floor wythe (outer layer of wall) just _fell off the building_!

After jumping through ridiculous bureaucracy to get work started on the project ($45,000, essentially split 19 ways and due within 30 days), it seems like things are finally getting started. Hopefully by the time I get back from Colombia, that damn thing will be fixed. At that point, I&#8217;d like to think there&#8217;s nothing else major that we need to worry about, but I&#8217;m not that naïve. Instead, I&#8217;ll just try to anticipate everything. Burst pipes? Fire? Earthquake?

Welcome to condo ownership. Do I dare move up to a _house_?
