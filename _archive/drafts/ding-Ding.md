In what may be my geekiest admission, I just hit level 60 in [World of Warcraft](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/). It only took me 17 days, 17 hours, and 45 minutes of playing time, spread out over the course of a year and two weeks. Woo-hoo!

It&#8217;s strange. When I first downloaded the demo of the game over the holidays a year ago, I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d like it: I don&#8217;t like RPGs, and I generally don&#8217;t like fantasy. WoW is just _fun_. And so addicting!

Now to get started on those thank-you notes&#8230;
