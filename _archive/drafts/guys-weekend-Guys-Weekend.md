I like Nina already. She demonstrated her father&#8217;s gift for courtesy by patiently delaying her arrival just long enough for the [guys](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tcob/124920148/in/set-72057594101474958//) to enjoy their annual [retreat](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tcob/sets/72057594101474958/) to Shell Lake, Wisconsin. I&#8217;m not sure what these [signs](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tcob/124919832/in/set-72057594101474958/) have to do with anything, but it can&#8217;t possibly be good.
