My mother has to be one of the last people to carry on using the term &#8220;doggie bag.&#8221; Combined with her thick Colombian accent, it sounds hilarious. I have yet to witness a waiter understand exactly what she&#8217;s asking for. It was especially funny last Saturday night, when she made the request of our very Indian waiter. Ah, when worlds collide.
