I&#8217;m moving TCOB to Dreamhost after experimenting with GoDaddy for several months. GoDaddy was fine, but it didn&#8217;t allow for as much technical experimentation. Furthermore, several of their processes seemed convoluted. I&#8217;m looking forward to trying out Subversion on Dreamhost as well. I&#8217;ll post again to this blog when everything seems moved.
