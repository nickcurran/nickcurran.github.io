Yesterday, while over at Ryan&#8217;s watching the Vikings meet everyone&#8217;s expectations, I taught Nina a new trick! She was sitting on her father&#8217;s lap and grinning at me. So I started sticking my tongue out at her, and to my amazement, she did it right back! Ryan said she had never stuck her tongue out before. Later, while alone with Jess, Nina was doing it again on her own! I couldn&#8217;t have been more proud. Next, the finger. This has to be more fun that having my own children!
