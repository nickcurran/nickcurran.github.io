Ever since I finished college and started working desk jobs, my weight has gone up gradually. For the first several years, this was a good thing. 5&#8217;10&#8221;, 145 lbs was not quite an attractive physique. When I hit 30, I was at 164 and pretty fit &#8211; exercising regularly.

By the end of last winter, I was at 187. I didn&#8217;t look that good and I didn&#8217;t feel that good. When my [ultimate league](http://www.mnultimate.org/) started up in May, I couldn&#8217;t keep up with anyone. Shortly after that, I had my annual physical. I know BMI is a rough estimate at best, but the chart on the wall had me square in the middle of the overweight classification. When my blood work came back a week later, my cholesterol was (borderline) high for the first time. I was ashamed. I was also determined to turn it around.

I&#8217;ll save the suspense and report that by this weekend I&#8217;ve successfully lost 23 lbs. I&#8217;m back to 164, and I&#8217;m at least as fit as I was 7 years ago. This is how I did it, most of it is pretty basic:

  1. Eat Less &#8211; I really think this is the most important. At every meal I would consider what portion size I would have eaten. I then ate 50-75% as much. For example, I love Indian buffets. In the past I would typically take two or three trips. Now, I only take one.
  2. Exercise More &#8211; 45 minutes or more of exercise at least 6 days a week.
  3. Eat Better &#8211; I cut down on fried foods and sweets. My snacks were almost entirely fruit and nuts. More salads, very few appetizers.
  4. Punishment &#8211; Some of my favorite foods are french fries, potato chips, and buffalo wings. I love bacon and cheese on my hamburgers. I was ashamed of how far it had gotten, and I punished myself by vowing to eat absolutely no wings, fries or potato chips until I hit my goal. I could still eat hamburgers, but they were never with bacon and cheese. This also presents a nice little reward for reaching the goal: the punishment can stop.
  5. No Cheating &#8211; I stuck to the rules no matter what. It&#8217;s easy to say something&#8217;s a special occasion or to use a vacation as an excuse to take a break, but I think that&#8217;s highly counterproductive. A lot of people use exercise as an excuse to eat more. I didn&#8217;t.

I&#8217;m really happy with my progress here. Now that I&#8217;m at my goal, I intend to maintain the exercise level and better diet, while reducing the punishment as long as I stay under 165. While I don&#8217;t think I need to lose any weight, I would like to lower my body fat percentage. I feel a lot better, and I want that to continue.
