In other news, I recently broke my left collarbone. It really  
hurt. A lot. But even as I could feel the pain through three shots of  
morphine, I was chillin&#8217; in the ER and laughing with Marc &#8211; who always  
said he&#8217;d take me to the hospital some day. As I noticed the overdosed  
teenagers and gunshot victims around me, I was pretty grateful for my  
relative good health.
