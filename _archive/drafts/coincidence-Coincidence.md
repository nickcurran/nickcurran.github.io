So I&#8217;m watching [Delicatessen](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0101700/), an earlier film by the director of [Am&eacute;lie](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0211915/) (one of my favorites). In one scene, a tenant who is late on his rent is showing the landlord (and butcher) the new things he has to trade for his late dues. Here&#8217;s where the weirdest coincidence of my life happened:

The first thing the tenant pulls out is a non-sensical looking device. The landlord asks, &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;

The tenant says, &#8220;It&#8217;s a rat call. This is the female version. It attracts male rats.&#8221; He begins playing it, and it makes a funny sound.

_At this exact moment, a mouse appeared in my living room, having just made it&#8217;s way out of my kitchen_. Crazy.
