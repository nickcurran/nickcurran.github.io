It was [a great trip](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tcob/sets/72157613137913167/). Fantastic weather, really good snow, no injuries, and my favorite part about Big Sky: [no lift lines](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tcob/3239847833/in/set-72157613137913167/). The _interns_, as Ryan dubbed them, did really well. As predicted, I certainly had my work cut out for me just trying to keep up.

We got a lot of fun pictures too. Mine are [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tcob/sets/72157613137913167/); Ryan&#8217;s are [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thekesslers/sets/72157613302077443/). My favorite has to be [this shot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thekesslers/3251461945/in/set-72157613302077443/) by Ryan. On the afternoon of the last day, we split up for a while. The boys headed to the terrain park while Ryan and I rode a couple blues we hadn&#8217;t seen yet. Our timing was perfect, because our next lift ride took us right over the park while Ben was making his run. He hit the C-box perfectly, and we were able to snap off some aerial photos. This all happened without any coordination.

I already can&#8217;t wait to go back, and the interns will be more than welcome when they&#8217;re ready for their true apprenticeship.
