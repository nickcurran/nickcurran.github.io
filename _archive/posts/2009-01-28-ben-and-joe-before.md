I&#8217;ve always loved this picture, taken of my brothers Ben and Joe before their first snowboarding lesson. The total lack of enthusiasm on Joe&#8217;s face kills me. In 2003, I had the pleasure of teaching them how to ride. It was a struggle at first, but by the end of the day, they were both riding, turning, and stopping on their own, carving up the blues at Afton Alps. They&#8217;ve both become good riders, and I&#8217;m proud to have been a part of that.

Six years later, I feel very lucky to be able to bring them along to Big Sky this weekend. It&#8217;ll be their first exposure to real mountain snowboarding. I&#8217;m sure this time it&#8217;ll be me who struggles to keep up, and I&#8217;m hoping they&#8217;ll teach me a trick or two. My FS 270 needs work. This time, I&#8217;m assured that they&#8217;re very excited, and I hope to post a successful &#8220;After&#8221; picture soon.
