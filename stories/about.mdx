Greetings! Thanks for visiting tcob.com; I&apos;m Nick. I like <a href='https://photos.tcob.com' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>photography</a> and <a href='http://movies.tcob.com' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>movies</a>, travel and pickleball. The <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>OnlyFans page</a> is still in progress. In the meantime, here are some other pages, remnants of my blogging era: the <Link href='/tray'>tray story</Link> and my <Link href='/prk'>PRK experience</Link>. Read on if you're bored!

## Me

I'm an Irish-Colombian Minnesotan forever enjoying my extremely late thirties, born in Edina and raised in the suburbs of West Saint Paul and Mendota Heights. My early education was found in the [finest public schools](http://www.isd197.org/) of the area. After high school, I studied at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), graduating from their [Carlson School of Management](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/) with a [BSB in MIS](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/degrees/undergraduate/majors-and-minors/management-information-systems). Later I earned my [MS in Software Engineering](https://software.stthomas.edu/) from the [University of St. Thomas](https://www.stthomas.edu/).

Thanks to that education, I've enjoyed 25+ years as a software engineer in a wide variety of industries. Today I'm happy to work in Boston Scientific's Active Implantable Sytems division, where I lead development of iOS apps that interact with implanted medical devices. BSC is an excellent employer, and I'm proud of the work we do.

## TCOB

Wondering what TCOB stands for? _Taking Care of Business!_

I registered tcob.com on February 20, 2000 while watching a Seinfeld rerun after work. Kramer was up to his usual shenanigans, and Jerry asked him what he was doing. "TCB," was Kramer's response. Against his better judgment, Jerry asked what that stood for, and Kramer proudly responded, "Takin' Care of Business." I had wanted a catchy domain name of my own for a while, and tcb.com sounded perfect. I looked it up, certain that it would be taken. Of course it was, but I decided to try tc**o**b.com... just in case.

Amazingly, it was available. I jumped on it. At the time, four-letter domain names were impossible to find. And they continue to be, especially if they might stand for something memorable. Certainly any common word or acronym is taken.

TCB was Elvis's motto, and who can forget the classic BTO tune/Office Depot advertising campaign? Anyway, I like having tcob.com. People have expressed interest in purchasing it over the years, while everything is certainly for sale, I have yet to hear a worthy offer.

## The _Infamous_ Nick Curran

While the main character in the American _classic_ [Basic Instinct](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103772/) was also named Nick Curran, similarities between his story and mine are purely coincidental.
