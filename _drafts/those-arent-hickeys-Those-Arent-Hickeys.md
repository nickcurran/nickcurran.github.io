My bachelor party is this Saturday, and I couldn&#8217;t be more excited. While we&#8217;re generally a tame bunch when it comes to this sort of thing, you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to a more _fun_ bunch. We&#8217;ll spend the day playing paintball and dodgeball, enjoy a nice dinner and cocktails, and finish it off with a poker tournament. I&#8217;m due for a win.

At any rate, talking about bachelor party paintball (a tradition among us), got Ryan and I reminiscing about an infamous match played at Anthony&#8217;s bachelor party. When I play, I get fully geared up: full camo in battle dress, gloves, even a cup. No skin exposed, except for perhaps a small strip of neck between my collar and the mask. Practically an impossible spot to hit, especially _the way I move_.

Practically. Sure enough, a game or two in to it, I got blasted in the neck. A huge welt arose. I was pissed, but oh well. It couldn&#8217;t happen again right? Wrong. It happened again, in the very next game &#8211; hitting me with almost perfect symmetry.

I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve recalled that for you. Now that it&#8217;s out there, I can feel good about it: there&#8217;s no way it could happen again, right?
