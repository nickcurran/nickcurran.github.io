Not having wanted a dog in the first place, I was surprised by how hard I took our loss of Maeby last March. In her too-brief 22 months with us, she really endeared herself. She had tons of personality, and we will always miss her.

We adopted our new beagle, Lemon, in May &#8211; tomorrow marks three months. Hoping to have more years together this time around, we went with a younger dog &#8211; she&#8217;s probably about ten months old. As the video above shows, she can be a lot more challenging that Maeby was, but I <del>think</del> hope as she gets older, she&#8217;ll be just as fun.
