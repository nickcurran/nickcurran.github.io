I finally had the pleasure of a [Fountains of Wayne](http://www.fountainsofwayne.com/) concert on Sunday. Originally slated to open for Joan Jett at the [State Fair](http://www.mnstatefair.org/), they ended up playing a free show when she canceled. They&#8217;ve been one of my favorite bands since the first time I heard they&#8217;re infections &#8220;Radiation Vibe.&#8221;

They played a very tight set featuring almost all my favorite songs (&#8220;Girl I Can&#8217;t Forget&#8221; was probably wishful thinking anyway). Unfortunately, there were quite a few silly frat boys in the party who knew nothing of FoW except for their huge hit single, &#8220;Stacy&#8217;s Mom&#8221; &#8211; a great 80s/The Cars tribute. They kept yelling &#8220;Stacy&#8217;s Mom&#8221; throughout the show, going so far as to chant en masse.

Eventually, they played it, and the crowd went nuts in a big pogo party. It was actually a really cool scene, very excited crowd, great music, my sweet sugar on my arm. It was then I noticed the American flag waving through the smoke machine in the distance behind the stage. It cemented it all together for me.

Anyway, the moment the song ended, about 30 of these plaid short/Abercrombie wearing dudes just filed out, missing the best song of the night &#8211; &#8220;Radiation Vibe&#8221; with a medley of 80s classic over the guitar solo. What a bunch of lame-os.
