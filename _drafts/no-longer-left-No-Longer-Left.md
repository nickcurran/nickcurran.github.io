&#8230; of the dial. [Minnesota Public Radio](http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/services/thecurrent/) launched a new radio station (KCMP &#8211; 89.3 FM) this morning, and it&#8217;s instantly everything these Twin Cities have been missing since the brilliant Rev 105 left the air years ago. The Current, as this new station is called, is even better &#8211; essentially the same eclectic (don&#8217;t say _alternative_) format, but with **no commercials**! The station is so good that I&#8217;m not even missing my iPod, which is out for repairs after a tragic, locker room plummet. Atmosphere, Wilco, The Replacements, Death Cab for Cutie, Luna&#8230; all in the first 45 minutes&#8230; does it get any better than this?
