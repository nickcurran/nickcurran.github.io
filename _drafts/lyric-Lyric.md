Woo-hoo! I have a niece! Carlos and Christin&#8217;s brand new baby, Lyric Isabelle, was born this evening, 20 inches long and weighing in at 7 lbs. 1 oz. I hear mother and child are doing very well, although father was exhausted and mumbling on the phone. Congrats to them both! Pictures soon to follow.
