Woof! We finally have a dog. Amy&#8217;s wanted one for as long as I&#8217;ve known her, so I knew the time would come eventually. Over the winter, settled in the house, we agreed to get one sometime this spring or summer, after Hawaii. We both did breed research, and I eventually determined I wanted a beagle (_before_ Uno won Westminster, _ahem_).

[Petfinder](http://www.petfinder.com/) was a great resource when we actually started looking for dogs. They let you easily search through every shelter and rescue organization for the type of dog you want, and you can specify breed, age range, size, location, or any combination.

When we finally did narrow it down to a couple we liked, [Happy Hound Rescue](http://www.happyhoundrescue.org/) was really great. They were very helpful and responsive, and seemed genuinely interested in matching us with a dog that really fit, resulting in a happier dog and happier owners. I&#8217;m glad they did, because Maeby is perfect for us.

Jenny, as the rescue had named her, turned up in our search last week, and we both had a good feeling about her. She was mature, house trained, crate trained, and seemed sweet and quite cute. Amy set up the adoption, and she arrived on Sunday. We named her [Maeby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maeby), after the [Arrested Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested_Development_%28TV_series%29) character, because, like her namesake, she&#8217;s curious and determined and I suspect prone to find trouble if we&#8217;d let her.

Maeby is about 5 years old, a bit overweight (but not for long), and possibly a bit arthritic. Like any beagle, she can become fixated on a scent trail. She sleeps all night and loves hanging out with us on the couch. Fortunately, unlike some beagles, she doesn&#8217;t make much noise or get too excited about much&#8230; except White Castle. Amy brought some home for me the other night, and Maeby started baying and bouncing around like we&#8217;d never seen her do. She really wanted those burgers!
