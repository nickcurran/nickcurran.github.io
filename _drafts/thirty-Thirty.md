I&#8217;ve posted a few random recent [photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tcob/sets/72057594101467052/) from the past month or so. I spent a weekend in Chicago with little sister, where we rocked out at the Strokes concert and got sick at Six Flags. I can&#8217;t go on rides anymore without getting sick! Does this mean I&#8217;m getting old? Is there a cure (for either the aging or the motion-sickness)?

The other shots are from a small, [three](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tcob/124916250/in/set-72057594101467052/)-way 30th birthday dinner at Rossi&#8217;s for Ryan, Jason, and me. Fun times, despite the fact that I was [wearing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tcob/124916114/in/set-72057594101467052/) a full pint of beer within two minutes of my arrival.
