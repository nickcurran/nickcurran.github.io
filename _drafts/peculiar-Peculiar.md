In the past week, I have found four half-empty (or half-full if you like) containers of Coca Cola near the end of our driveway, one 20-oz bottle Vanilla and 3 12-oz cans of Classic. Coke is among my favorite beverages, and as such I&#8217;m left to wonder why they aren&#8217;t finishing them? And then, why are they leaving them neatly standing on my property?
