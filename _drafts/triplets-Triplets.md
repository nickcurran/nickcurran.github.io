I saw the [_The Triplets of Belleville_](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0286244/) last night at the Lagoon Theater. This is easily the funniest, most interesting, and most beautiful animated film I&#8217;ve ever seen, all with only two or three lines of spoken dialogue. Do whatever you have to do to see this movie. If it loses the best animated film Oscar to _Finding Nemo_, there is clearly no justice, reason, or logic in those awards. But we already know that. See _Saving Private Ryan_ losing to _Shakespeare in Love_ or the **perfect** _LA Confidential_ losing to _Titanic_.
