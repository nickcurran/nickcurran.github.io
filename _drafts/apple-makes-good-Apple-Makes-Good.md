I&#8217;m generally no fan of Apple. Their marketing is so frequently filled with lies. The Mac v. PC ads are impossibly smarmy. And the Apple Stores: the retail employees are either so uninformed or so blinded by corporate idolatry it makes me ill. (Don&#8217;t get me started on the so-called &#8220;genius&#8221; bar.)

Mac OS has its moments, but for every cool feature (Expos√©, Spaces), there is as much awfulness (menu bar, Finder, window management, keyboard shortcuts). If you really think it&#8217;s any better than Vista, it&#8217;s probably time to put the Kool-Aid down. And the dev environment, Xcode? What a usability nightmare.

But I&#8217;ve certainly been a fan of their hardware ever since my 3rd-gen iPod. Their computers, phones, and media players are certainly the best looking around, and they always seem very solid. With that in mind, curious about iPhone development, and needing a laptop for grad school, I made the plunge and bought my first Mac &#8211; a refurbished MacBook Pro (MBP). This was in September.

Three weeks later, conveniently past the return period, Apple announced a new line of MBPs that were much cooler than mine. On top of that, mine started making a really high-pitched noise at medium brightness in Vista. Two separate repairs by the &#8220;geniuses&#8221; did nothing to fix the problem, and the laptop was beginning to show signs of having been taken apart and reassembled by non-experts.

Here I was seemingly stuck with an &#8220;obsolete&#8221; machine that made my ears ring and didn&#8217;t nearly shine like it had only six weeks ago.

So I was elated yesterday when I called Apple to pursue a third repair or possible exchange. After only a few minutes on the phone with customer service and a few more minutes on hold, they gave me an exception to the return policy &#8211; I&#8217;ll be getting a full refund for the &#8220;old&#8221; one. I was really impressed by this; kudos to Apple on a great &#8220;make good.&#8221; My new MBP is already on the way.
