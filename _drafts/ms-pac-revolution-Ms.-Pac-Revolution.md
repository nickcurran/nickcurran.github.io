I&#8217;ve always liked [Dance Dance Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution) a lot, so when it came out for the Xbox 360, I had to get it immediately. Today as I was playing, it occurred to me that I could use the dance pad to play other games. I fired up Xbox Live Arcade, and sure enough, I was playing Ms. Pac Man with my feet in no time! I scored a whopping 800 points, but I can see a future here. Say goodbye to those last ten pounds!
