This will forever be one of my favorite shots, and I&#8217;ll never forget it. I arrived late to watch my nephew Bryce&#8217;s first game of a local tournament. A few minutes later, I noticed he was on deck. I decided to warm up my camera with a couple of shots. I was in position just as he stepped up to the plate. He took a big swing at the first pitch, and I took a single shot of that.

I looked up to see where the ball was going, and noticed it was going pretty far. Back, back, back&#8230; just over the fence&#8230;

Bryce&#8217;s First Home Run!

It was so cool! Later on, with two outs and down 3-2 in the final inning, Bryce demonstrated great skill in another play by [stealing home](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tcob/2481407386/in/set-72157604987376529/) and [clearly beating](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tcob/2480596549/in/set-72157604987376529/) the tag to tie the game. Unfortunately the fix was in, as the [so-called](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tcob/2480597135/in/set-72157604987376529/) umpire made a [terrible call](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tcob/2480597753/in/set-72157604987376529/), ending the game.

We know the truth, Bryce! Congrats on an awesome game!
